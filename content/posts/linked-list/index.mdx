### Linked List

#### Introduction:

A Linked List is a linear data strcture like arrays but what sets it apart from arrays is that the data is not stored in contiguous manner in the memory.

In Linked List, the building block that stores the data is called a _Node_.
Apart from storing the data, a node also stores the reference to the next node in the sequence.

The first element of the Linked List is called _head_ node and one can travese through the whole linked list sequentially by going through the next nodes pointed from a particular node starting from the head node.
The last element of the Linked List has a special property that it doesn't point to any further node, it points to `null`, marking the end of the list.

Since a particular node is only reachable by its previous node, a direct access to a particular node isn't possible in Linked List unlike arrays and that's the biggest difference.

#### Insertion:

To insert an element in the Linked List one has to travese to the last element of the Linked List starting from the head.
Then, one can create a new node, make it point to `null` (marking it as the new last element of the list) and make the last node point to this newly created node.

#### Deletion:

To delete an element `el` from the Linked List we first need to find an element say `prevEl` whose `next` property references to el i.e., `prevEl.next === el`.
Then one can simply make `prevEl`'s `next` property refer to the `el`'s `next` property.
Hence, esentially removing the connection between `prevEl` and `el` by overwriting `prevEl.next` and making a new connection between `prevEl` and `el.next`.

#### Reversing a Linked List:

When we reverse a linked list, the tail becomes the new head and the head becomes the new tail.
We can achieve this by traversing the linked list with the help of two pointers, `currentEl` and `prevEl`.
We start by setting the `currentEl` to head of the linked list and `prevEl` to `null`.

Now, whenever we are at a particular element, what we do is:

- Store its next element in a temporary variable called `nextEl`
- Make `currentEl`'s next point to the `previousEl`
- And then making `currentEl` jump to the next element in the original list by setting it to `nextEl`

```ts
function getReversedLinkedList(head: ListNode | null): ListNode {
  let currentNode = head;
  let prevNode = null;

  while (currentNode) {
    const nextNode = currentNode.next;
    // Point current's next to point to prev pointer
    currentNode.next = prevNode;
    // Update current and prev pointers
    prevNode = currentNode;
    currentNode = nextNode;
  }

  return prevNode;
}
```

#### Linked List based questions:

##### [Remove Nth Node From End of List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list)

**Problem Statement:**

Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

**Naive Solution:**

We can first reverse the linked list and get `reversedHead = getReversedLinkedList(head)` pointer.
If `n === 1` then we can simply remove the `reversedHead` from the linked list by setting `reversedHead = reversedHead.next`.
Finally, we can return this reversed linked list's reversed linked list's head: basically, `return getReversedLinkedList(reversedHead)`.

If `n > 1` then we start traversing from `reversedHead` till the end of the reversed linked list and keep a `position` pointer.
We then travese to the node positioned at `n - 1` - the node just previous to the one we want to delete and simply skip over the nth node from (n - 1)th node by making (n - 1)th node point to nth node's next node.

After we are done, we can simply return `getReversedLinkedList(reversedHead)` that will give us the head of the linked list in the order we received it in input.

The code for the above approach can be found [here](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/677733142/)

**Solution using two pointers**:

The above solution works but we are traversing the linked list 3 times.
One for reversing the original list, one for removing the element from the reversed list and one for reversing the reversed linked list.
Instead, we can solve this by traversing the linked list only once, How?

We initialise two pointers - `leftPointer` which points to the `head` and a `rightPointer` which is ahead by the `leftPointer` by a distance of `n`.
This way, whenever our `rightPointer` reaches `null` our `leftPointer` will be at the node we want to remove since it will be exactly `n` steps behind from the end.
If we go by this approach, we will also need to keep a `previousPointer` for our `leftPointer` so we can make our `previousPointer` skip `leftPointer` when our `rightPointer` has reached null and left is at the node we want to delete.

But, rather than comparing `rightPointer` with `null` we can modify the condition by checking if `rightPointer` is at the last node of the linked list, meaning `rightPointer.next === null`.
This way `leftPointer` will be at the node just before the one that needs to be deleted and we can skip over the node we want to delete without maintaining the `previousPointer`!
